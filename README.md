# HotHotHot Front End

Created as part of the course [ECUE11] entitled "Languages for the Web". 

Since I have already done several projects in CSS and I have never done a project in SASS, I imposed myself to develop it in SASS and Bootstrap.

##  My skills

|    		|  Level   |			|  	   Level           
|-----------|----------|------------|--------------
|HTML		|   `Good` | BOOTSTRAP  | `A little`       
|CSS 		|   `Good` | SASS       | `Not Use`          
|JS/JQuery  |   `Good` | PHP        | `Good` 

# Develop with
`BootStrap`   `ChartJS` `HTML` `JavaScript` `SCSS`

# ðŸ“– The architecture

â”‚â”€â”€ img         # Directory containing the pictures
|â”€â”€ css         # Directory containing the files CSS & SCSS
â”‚â”€â”€ js          # Directory containing the files JS
â””â”€â”€ ...         # HTML files
```

## Personal assessment / Synthesis

For the synthesis, I find that it was an interesting project with rules to follow like no div and span in order to have
a more readable, understandable code.
We had the freedom to learn and use new technologies. (CharJS, SASS, Bootstraps)
